      <h2>原文（未标注）</h2>
      <div class="content">According to the Center for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, vaccination is one of the safest and most recommended preventive care measures available to preserve health among both, children and adults. Immunizations are an essential component of preventive medicine. Access to vaccines, however, varies across the U.S. population. For instance, there is an abundance of research and data suggesting that Hispanic groups have the lowest rates of vaccination compared to most other race/ethnic groups residing in the United States. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health reported that Hispanic adults were 30% less likely to have received influenza flu shot, hepatitis, or pneumonia vaccinations compared to non-Hispanic whites within the last 12 months. 

Disparities in vaccination rates are even greater among Mexican migrant populations for measles, flu, and pertussis (BPT). A 2014 study concluded that Mexican immigrants are highly underserved and the type of work they do (mostly construction, agriculture, services) places this group at the greatest risk for infectious diseases. The study found that, less than one-fifth of mobile Mexican migrants received an influenza vaccination in the previous year. This is a substantially low rate compared to the overall rates found among adults living in the United States (42%) and Mexico (44%). A 2015 study conducted by the American Public Health Association found evidence supporting similar findings: that is, when compared with other ethnic groups (non-Hispanic Whites, Asians, and Blacks), Hispanics had the lowest vaccination coverage for influenza and pneumococcus. 

Similarly, access to affordable health care is more difficult for immigrants, especially if they are undocumented. Due to the nature of their jobs (high risk), the context of poverty in which they live, and the low wages they receive, males are at greater risk for communicable diseases and work-related injuries. Furthermore, preventive medicine information is less available to limited English speaking immigrants, especially men. 

Adult immunization practices are a topic that in spite of its importance have not received sufficient and systematized attention from public health researchers and health officials. For instance, there is a scarcity of literature reporting specifically on vaccination practices by gender and ethnic differences. Although it is known that lower class individuals and adult males in general of all racial/ethnic groups receive less preventive health care than higher SES males, so in this regard Mexican-origin males may not be too different from other males regardless of race or ethnic origin. 

The barriers for vaccination access among minority group males are complex and strongly related to traditional gender roles. Some of the reasons adult patients do not receive vaccines, as reported by clinicians, include resistance due to cost, needle opposition -“If I don’t have to get the shot [for work] then I don’t want it”-, unwillingness to miss work, pain avoidance, and lack of knowledge about adult vaccines. Additionally, clinicians mentioned more hesitance coming from male adult Hispanic patients than from other groups. In general, the health system seems to exclude males as there is a significant focus on immunizations for pregnant women and their newborn children. Further, the lack of knowledge or misinformation parents hold regarding vaccines not only affects their own heath, but it can also turn into a barrier that prevents children from receiving vaccination.
